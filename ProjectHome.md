The project is called Errare (in connection with its scenario), it's an RPG which will be an MORPG (Multiplayer Online RPG).
Errare is in 3D (OpenGL) and programmed in JAVA!
The development started in June 2005. Erarre started with 5 developers and 1 infographist.
Errare is LGPL licenced, developped during our free time and without any compensation.

Currently, it's possible to move in a 3D world randomly generated, fight several monsters (neural network-type AI, manage your hero (XP, life, mana, backpack, ...) and play with friends on LAN.

The scenario, written several years ago, is epic.
The gameplay is inspired from existing MMORPG's (Everquest, WoW).

This project is innovative given it's development in JAVA, which means that it runs everywhere (mostly), that is, with exactly the same source code (and even binary code), it's possible to play Errare on Windows, Linux, Mac, 32 or 64bits... whereas this is not possible with actual games.

The LGPL licence of the game implies that data (images, models, sounds, ...) can be reused, modified, distributed, by other people though while retaining the names of the original authors and the original licence (LGPL).
