DESCRIPTION

   I wanted to make a model with totaly different weapons from the
   standard and somthing other than skin tight clothing. 

   The model has 695 polygons and the skin is 67% efficient 
   (I had it higher but this was easier to skin).

   

INSTALLATION

   Unzip the file into the same directory as the Quake2 folder,
   the sub-directories will be created by the zip file

TO USE

   Run quake2 go to Multiplay / PlayerSetup / Model and select
   Sorcerer. You can then choose a skin.

   If that doesn't work, or you get the "No Valid Players Found"
   bug, just add the following to your cfg file at the bottom.
	
	skin Sorcerer/Sorcerer
