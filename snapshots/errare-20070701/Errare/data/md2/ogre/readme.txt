Model description	: From places unknown, a single, pregnant Ogre was marooned on Earth, the 
			  Ogre quickly adapted, and a vast population rapidly grew in our fertile 
			  environment. Ultimately, the Ogre population had to pay for the right to 
			  live on our planet. They were forced to sign-up and join the forces being 
			  sent to Stroggos in the front line of defence. Ogres proved to be very 
			  agressive warriors, difficult to Kill and they never back down!
