Hello people....
		there once was a time, a golden age, when people all
over the world looked after and cared for their loved ones....

		but now.. no one, I mean no one, truely wishes to take
care of their houseplants. They wilt, dejected by their owners. When
will any of us learn!! Plants must be given respect!! or this sort of 
thing happens...

THE SCENE
---------

		A vicious war of capture the flag is 
raging on, blues edging in front of the reds as the body count rises
and all thoughts of the flag are forgotten.
		3 soldiers are on the move heading into the red's
territory, all place their silencers on their sotguns. Jeering of the
red team can be heard in front of them, they start to edge from behind 
boxes. The soldier at the back feels a hairy tentacle like arm tap him
on the back... "Oh shit!" He turns round to see a man sized venus fly
trap staring, well staring without eyes, back at him. Jaws as big
as two dustbin lids clamped around the guy's head his screams still
audiable, his body struggling to break free from this B&Q garden center
monstrosity's slobbering jaws. The acid begins to digest his head...
..3 more come from the shadows.. the blue team is done for!!

		However you'll be happy to know, this model can't
actually do that [yet]. But this Venus Fly trap's still one pissed
off pot plant. The plant will however get his come-up-ance from his
barrel rolling compound eyed friend... First time when someones been
killed they promptly chewed upon by their pintsized enemy. Well I'm 
it's actually happened lots of times but I think this is the first
plug-in player model to do so [if I'm wrong give me an e-mail to put 
me straight].

		Here it is the first fraggable pot plant!!
