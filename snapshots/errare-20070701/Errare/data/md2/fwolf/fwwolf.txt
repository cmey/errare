Model description       : 

This is a 773 polygon mesh of a female Werewolf, blending human and lupine feaures with an eye towards realism. It was built and animated in 3d studio max as a learning excercise in the production use of Character Studio plugins for 3ds Max 2.5, Biped and Physique. All other modifications were using the standard Quake2  tools. it has Custom sounds, provided by Steve Irvine.  it comes with 12 skins including CTF skins (red and blue) for the sounds a modification of the config file was suggested. Cut and paste the following to your config file in your baseq2 directory, or cut and paste into the console, while Q2 is running.

 bind u "taunt ";"play_howl.wav" 

"overthere" would be the .wav file you would have copied from the fwwolf folder  into a
sound folder in your quake2/baseq2 directory.

This would make the model that would point and play the howling wolf sound during
her taunt 9which is a howling action) get everyone on the server to do this and you can
have your own pack of howling wolves.


The standard weapon.md2 is the Soviet AK 47 early varient with the milled reciever.
All Team play motions are enabled.

----------------------------------
 War with Stroggos was hard on Mother Russia. That the Russian Federation
 spanned several time zones, was a UN industrial center, and troop training
  was one thing, but a disproportionate amount of the ordinance dropped by 
 the Stroggs seemed to fall on the farms, cities, and infrastructure of the
 Motherland. Extreme situations demanded desperate measures, and as in her 
 past, Russia found the strength, the will, and the methods to survive and 
 make her enemies pay dearly.
 
 Senior Academician Gennady Vasilivich  Rykov, Professor of Genetics at the 
 Moscow University, found the choice between medical ethics and his 
 country's survival was not difficult at all: as in most such decisions, 
 survival is usually the best choice. He formulated a plan and submitted it 
 to the Military authorities. They would obtain infants, either from in 
 vitro incubation, or infant orphans from the bombardment as subjects for 
 an "enhancement" program.
 
 The plan was approved and authorized, and test subjects were collected at 
 the first facility in Ekaterinburg. The subjects were infected with a form 
 of the lycanthropy virus and then secretly transported to a facility on 
 the U.N. Moon Base. Isolating the infected group from the general 
 population of Earth and operational autonomy from U.N. oversight were all 
 benefits that outweighed the costs of the program.
 
 On the moon, as Professor Rykov had expected, the subjects assumed and 
 maintained a lupine form. Infant subjects were used due to the fact that 
 it is easier to train young animals than older ones. The base was a 
 perfect controlled environment, and the young pups were socialized into 
 pack-sized groups.
 
 It was discovered that if the lycanthropes were raised in social groups or 
 packs, they were well adjusted mentally, rather than the sociopathic 
 singletons of historical record. This is not to say they were not 
 dangerous. They lacked the timidity of normal lupines, and were quite 
 protective and territorial. When it was determined that they were trained 
 enough not to bite unprovoked, military experts were brought in to
 train them in the use of weapons and small unit tactics.
 
 As it turned out, they were not as smart as humans -- or rather they were 
 smart in different ways. They could understand simple voice commands 
 though they were unable to speak, and they made up for their 
 communications shortcomings with increased acuity of senses, increased 
 strength and endurance, and regeneration. Getting them used to the weapons 
 was no small feat, but the instructors slowly and patiently got them up to 
 infantry standards. Their tactics, while loose, had the advantage of pack 
 organization, and their ground speed made them very effective in hit and 
 run. It looked as if these subjects would be perfect for classic Russian 
 partisan operations.
 
 The lycanthropes were tricked into sleep pods and shipped along with the 
 Retribution Fleet to the moon-ringed planet of Stroggos. For their 
 partisan role, they were equipped cheaply with antique Soviet-era weapons 
 and huge containers of ammunition. They were dropped simultaneously with 
 the main Marine landings.  However their drop zones were great distances 
 from the main marine assault, as their intended role was to be harassment 
 of the Strogg defensive effort by snarling passages and generally slowing 
 their response times. This would have paid off if the Marine Landing Zone 
 had gone as predicted. Now there were werewolves loose and roaming the 
 halls of Stroggos.
 
 There were some "friendly fire" incidents as jittery Marines took shots at 
 unfamiliar, non-human silhouettes. After that the werewolves generally 
 avoided marines. Half eaten Strogg carcasses, unfamiliar footprints, and 
 shapes seen out of the corner of your eye, as well as piles of expended 
 shell casings of a caliber not used by the marines or Stroggs, added to 
 the rumors and stories surrounding  the possible existance of  werewolves. 
 The Russians said nothing, but as reports of the problems the werewolves 
 were causing filtered through, they'd smile -- the werewolves were the 
 Strogg's problem now.
 
 SKINS
 Anya: a fireteam leader from one of the first packs dropped in. She's 
 clever, cunning, and responsive to her subordinates. She received some of 
 the highest test scores in training, and continues to rack up an 
 impressive body count.
 
 Irina:  the omega of pack one. Underconfident and not highly skilled, she 
 does try her best for the team, and though not scoring highly, makes few 
 real mistakes.
 
 Katerina:  originally beta to Viktor's alpha, but upon Viktor's demise she 
 became Alpha of Pack 2. More of her "human'" intelligence may be showing 
 through, though the death of Viktor may have made her go a little 
 unstable. She's 'gone a bit peculiar,' dyeing her fur with Hi-C powder and 
 blue stamp pad ink to give herself a distinctive color, which is accented 
 by yellow shark dye from an aviator's survival vest.
 
 Ludmila:  a bit dippy, but as courageous as all out doors. What she lacks 
 in cleverness she makes up for in sheer love of firepower. Once a member 
 of Pack 1, she was the heavy weapons section of the fireteam, dishing out 
 grenades and RPG's with abandon. After a particularly nasty fire fight and 
 explosion she was thought dead, and Pack 1 moved on. Pack two found her...
 
 T_Ludmila:  this is what Ludmila looks like after Katerina's Pack 2 found 
 her. Always a follower, Ludmila has decorated herself with red and blue 
 stamp pad ink, and some rudimentary jewelry made from expended brass. Her 
 blissful optimism and thoughtlessness continues, although her skill with 
 the RPG has made Pack 2 quite a bit more combat effective.
 
 Petra:  shy, cautious and adverse to loud noises. Her coloration fits her 
 temperament, as she skulks in shadow and observes in silence. She uses an 
 immaculately maintained Dragunov sniper rifle in her duties as spotter and 
 sniper for Pack 2. Despite her timidity she is no coward, and will defend 
 the other members of the pack with her life.

Please install so that the final directory path looks like:

If there are problems with weapon viseability (null skin error messages in the top of the view window during game operation in software mode, or an orange and black weapon in GL mode), this means that the skin is not linked correctly, and may need to be linked using NST, and the weapon linking tutorial at the Q2pmp site <http://www.planetquake.com/q2pmp/> and look under "tools" for the application, and "Tutuorials" for th skin linking tutorial. "weapon.md2" links to "weapon.pcx". The Model has been tested, and does not seem to have this problem. The second cause of this problem is if the model directory is not exactly as stated above.

if the Model does not appear in the selection list, check the "Player's" Directory for any files that are not specifically directories. Move them or delete them, leaving only a directory for each model you have in your collection. A common error.
