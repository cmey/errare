Model description       : Ontra has no previous history, he was made up by me, born in my brain during one of those history classes where I wasn´t paying much attention. 
	He´s an anphibian tribe eel-hunter, he has tentacles instead of feet, and also has four back tentacles that end in deadly clubs... but since this is Quake 2 he has to depend on his high tek arsenal.
	Tempted by the meat from animals he can´t hunt in the seas and swamps, Ontra leaves his homeland whith his adaptive gun, expecting to frag a lot and get enough food for the season.

Additional Credits      : THIS MODEL WAS MADE WITH DARIN PETERSEN'S QTiP! It was the only great tool that could get my stuff from 3D studio max to md2 format. Qtip´s web page is: home.earthlink.net/~benthroop
