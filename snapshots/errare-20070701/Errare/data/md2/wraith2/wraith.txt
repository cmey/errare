Model description       : The Strogg hadn't always been a mix of metal and flesh. Thousands of years ago, they were flesh and blood.
			  Some of these Strogg developed a use of magic, of necromancy.  The Wraith is one of those necromancers, whose
			  eternal sleep has been disturbed by the war.


Other info              : My first model, so it was really a test-bed to find out how to do things.

Additional Credits to   : id Software, for such a customisable game.
			  Npherno for NST.
			  Philip Martin for Q2 Modeller.

			  Everybody at Q2PMP website for being so cool.
