by the request of the guys who recieved my last model "unknown"  here is the readme file for "bugger"

Well I origionaly was going to a classic biped model, wearing something like a 
football plate body armor, you can see the remains of this in the bugs main body.

The body was easy enough to make... but I couldn't hammer out a decent looking waist,
so I got mad at it and left it for about 2 days.  After that I started playing with
it, and when looking at it from a weird angle I noticed the bottom of it looked kinda like
a bugs abdomen so I layed it flat and got to work.  The legs look bad I know but that
is a nessecity of the poly count... I was hardpressed to get them to that.  

I made the head last and it shows my geting tired on the weekend it isn't symetrical,
and doesnt really have the right shape but it looks ok.  I had origionally planned to
give it a wicked set of pincers/mandibles but like I said before it was either mandibles
 or legs I chose legs... a 2 legg'd bug looks weird. altho that might inspire me for my next
"weirdo"

As for the animations some of the are sick... some are weird, but they turned out ok...
the only one I wasn't satisfied with was the last of the speciality ones... the second
claw at the air one... he was supposed to be going forward while clawing but umm it didn't
work.  all the others worked nicely... although for some reason in game all the deaths look VERY simaler and you always seem to see the second dead body mroe often than the others.


well i think that about wraps it up for this thing sorry for the shortness and sue me if my spellchecker is broken.
