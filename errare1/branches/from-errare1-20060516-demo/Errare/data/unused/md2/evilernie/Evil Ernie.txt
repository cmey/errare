Model description       : Also known as the Master of Annihilation, Evil Ernie is one Psychotic,
			  Undead teenager out to destroy all life...in search of megadeath!
			  Ernie was abused as a kid, and Lady Death found him when he accidently
			  entered her Endless Graveyard through his inner thoughts.  Inspired by
			  Lady Death, Evil Ernie found a partner in life...or should I say death.

Bugs/comments/excuses   : Some of the anims still seem a bit 'stiff' to me.  And I would've liked
			  to find an easier way to animate that hair and coat!  Maybe I should 
			  get me one of them thar fancy plugin type things.  

			  There is a slight seam where the right arm joins the shoulder, due to
			  the arm being part of the weapon.  It is largely unnoticeable unless 
			  your real close the the model.  And in my opinion, well worth for the
			  'bloody stump' effect when he dies!
			  
			  


Build/Animation time    : damn coat an hair took ages, even tho I skimped a bit.
