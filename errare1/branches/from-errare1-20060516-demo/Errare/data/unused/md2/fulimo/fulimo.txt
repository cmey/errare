Model description       : This is my first model and due to my lack of time, I did not have the chance jet to make it perfect. It was more to studie the potential of the Modelbuilder and how everything worked. To give slow computers a chance, the reduction of the number of faces was the primairy objective. 
I will improve everything, if more time is awailable to me. Unfortunately something with the skin of the perliminairy weapon went wrong, but I don't have a clue what. Please mail me, if you find out. The rest of the weapons will be implemented soon.

Additional Credits to   : everybody involved. :o)
