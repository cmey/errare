Player Model For Quake 2

Nemesis Media 

Necromicus & Morticus v1.01

The weapon model problem for those who don't use vwep has been fixed.
Sorry about that!

This Model is my second player model for Quake 2. 
There are two versions of this model, Necromicus and Morticus.
The reason I did this is because Necromicus' wings might cause 
problems for people, first they bump the poly count up a lot 
and they go way outside of the bounding box.
They look really cool though especially when you see someone 
jumping down on you from high above.

To save on download time I have removed all the duplicate files from the 
Morticus directory except for one. To use Morticus just copy
all the files from the Necromicus directory into the Morticus 
directory EXCEPT THE TRIS.MD2 AND THE JUMP1.WAV FILES!!!!!!!.

* Special note that the taunt sequence causes the model to triple
in size! This is to only be used in large open areas or else his 
head will disappear into the ceiling. *

If you are running a slow machine and don't want to be able
to see the wings even if someone else is using Necromicus then
just copy the tris.md2 from the Morticus directory and paste 
it over the tris.md2 in the Necromicus directory

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ONLY DIRECTORIES IN THE PLAYERS DIRECTORY!
NO ZIP FILES LYING AROUND IN THERE OR IT WON'T WORK!!!


If you are a developer.. well GIVE ME A JOB!!

Special thanx go out to:
Haplo
and CRBOT
for helping me test my model.
and also thanx to Fross and Chaos for your advice.

To install just put the directory "Necromicus" and "Morticus" in the players dir 
eg. c:\quake2\baseq2\players\Necromicus\<files>
eg. c:\quake2\baseq2\players\Morticus\<files>

Thanx all!
